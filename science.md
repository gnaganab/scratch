BSB: Welcome to Satyameva Jayathe discussion series.

Is palmistry a science?

```
BSR: Let's get to the point. If chemistry is a science, why not palmistry?
```

BSB: Sure, let us explore this question in the spirit of “Satyameva Jayate”

3:
If chemistry is a science, why not palmistry?

To address this question, we need to know,
What is science
What is chemistry
What is palmistry

```
Q: ok, that is fair.
```

4:
BSB: The word science is one of the most misused words in everyday conversation. It means many things to many people.

Let's see some meanings:

The observation, identification, description, experimental investigation, and theoretical explanation of phenomena.

OR,

Knowledge, that was gained through experience.

OR,

A systematic method

OR,

body of knowledge in a given area

The definition that covers all is: "body of knowledge in a given area" . Unfortunately is too broad. But let's deal with it.

5:

BSB:
Next, chemistry. Chemistry is the scientific discipline involved with compounds composed of atoms and molecules: their composition, structure, properties, behavior and the changes they undergo during a reaction with other compounds.

Simply put, body of knowledge about composition and reactions of natural matter.

6:

```
Q: how about palmistry?
```

BSB:
Palmistry is the claim of characterization and foretelling the future through the study of the palm.

Simply put, body of claims about predicting a person's future based on markings his/her palm.

```
Q: For chemistry you said body of knowledge. But for palmistry you said body of claims. Why this difference?
```
BSB: knowledge vs claim, we will get there.

7:

BSB:
Let's see, what is the meaning of knowledge? Knowledge is what we know, a collection of facts.

```
Q: Hey,
Chemistry is body of some knowledge.
Palmistry is body of some other knowledge.

So, if chemistry is a science, palmistry must be a science. Case closed!
```
8:

BSB:

Hmm... not so fast. Knowledge has some connection with facts or reality. We need to see if the claims made by chemistry and palmistry are real.

```
Q: Are we back to square-1?
```

BSB: Patience brother. Truth seeking is a noble endeavor.

BSB:
I would categorize all the subjects into two broad classes: open and close. I did this based on participation, application, and compatibility.

Let's look at the open subjects:
* people all over the world participate: in both development as well as usage.
* There would a wide variety of practical applications.
* Third, they are compatible with other subjects; meaning that subjects depend on one another.

Now, the closed subjects:
* only a closed group of people participate in the closed subjects. For example, some Telugu people use a type of house architecture, called Vaastu or more appropriately, Andhra Vaastu; because it is different from say, Gujarath Vaastu.
* Applications: though a large number of Teleugu people use Telugu Vaastu, they don't really rely on it. For example, when someone in the family falls sick, they don't change the house architecture to address the sickness, though Vaastu claims that certain configuration of architecture will bring long lasting good health.
* Next, compatibility: Other subjects do not use Vaastu. For example medical subjects or business plans do not use Vaastu, though Vaastu claims that it can bring health and wealth to the people that dwell in the building.

```
BSR: enough, that is a long lecture bro.

```

11:

BSB: I will try to be concise.

There are many varieties in open subjects: Natural sciences such as chemistry and biology, formal sciences- such as mathematics and information theory, social sciences such as economics and marketing, applied sciences such as medicine and engineering.

12:

BSB:

Some examples of closed subjects are: palmistry and Feng Shui.

13:

```
BSR: Open or close. Why does it matter?
```

14:

BSB: Open or closed: there are serious consequences to the methods that they practice.

Participation has two components: one is developing and the second is using it. When a wide variety of people and a lot of them work to create a science, it grows faster. And, when they use it, its defects will be found faster and possibly someone  will fix it. Diversity and wide participation means less bias, more growth, and less defects.

```
BSR: that makes sense. what else?
```

15:

BSB:

Application means, putting the claims to work. For example, marketing subject says how to promote a product. Companies world wide spend about a trillion dollars a year, applying marketing principles to promote their products. Popular usage is an indication of authenticity. People use more of what works and ignore what that doesn't work. This artificial selection will be missing for subjects that are not applied for practical use.

```
BSR: ok, fair. can you wrap it up now?
```

16:

BSB:

The third point, compatibility.

Open subjects are used by other open subjects. For example, chemistry is used by biology and biology is used by medicine. If there is a defect in chemistry, both biology and medical sciences will fail. Open subjects are like a structure made up of small Jenga blocks. Closed subjects are more like just one block. Closed subjects use other subjects but open subjects do not use any closed subjects.

Being used by another subject is the utmost endorsement for open subjects. Closed subjects lack such endorsement.

```
BSR: so what?
```

17:

BSB:

Open subjects grow rapidly. Closed subjects may change in style but rarely grow.

defects are exposed sooner in open subjects. It is rare that defects are in closed subjects.

Open subjects have practical applications. More importantly useful for other subjects. Closed subjects are rarely used by other subjects.

```
BSR: so, why are talking about all these subjects? Is palmistry a science?
```

18:

BSB:

Is palmistry a science? It is a closed subject. The claims are inconsistent, there is no empirical data about of variation of the claims, there is no serious usage of the claims in practical applications.

That means, there is evidence that that claims made by palmistry are real or factual. So, we are not sure that palmistry claims are considered knowledge. So, I am not sure that it is a science. When the claims are known to be real, we can certainly say that it is a type of real science.

```
BSR: you say yes or no: is palmistry a science?
```

BSB:

Lets say some people claim that there is a big ballon floating over Budha statue in Hyderabad. Do you say yes or now? You can say, you can't see it or don't find any effects of it but can not rule it out.

```
BSR: no, it won't work like that. Whoever makes the claim should convince me how they reached to that conclusion. The burden of proof is on them. Until they do that, in my dictionary, there is no ballon over Budha.
```

BSB:
Going by that policy- until the claims are known to be real, palmistry is not a science. As truth seekers, we should be open to accept palmistry to be a science as soon as the claims made by palmistry are known to be real. Truth seeking is a journey, not a destination.

```
BSR: ok, palmistry is not a science. Can you be more direct please? Enough, already!
```
